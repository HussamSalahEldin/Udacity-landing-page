## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Description

This is a project to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections. Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.
